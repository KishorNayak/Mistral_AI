LlamaIndex Workflows are a library for event-driven programming in JavaScript and TypeScript. It provides a simple and lightweight orchestration solution for building complex workflows with minimal boilerplate.

It combines event-driven programming, async context and streaming to create a flexible and efficient way to handle data processing tasks.

The essential concepts of Workflows are:

Events: are the core building blocks of Workflows. They represent data that flows through the system.
Handlers: are functions that process events and can produce new events.
Context: is the environment in which events are processed. It provides access to the event stream and allows sending new events.
Workflow: is the collection of events, handlers, and context that define the processing logic.
